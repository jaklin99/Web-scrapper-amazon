Spend the extra money and buy this monitor.  It\'s free of backlight strobing, it has very minimal IPS glow, it has FreeSync and supports G-Sync, and the picture is fantastic.  It\'s a near perfect monitor, but there were a few things I had to do first when setting this up:1. Go to LG\'s site and download the drivers.  It uses the same drivers as the 27GL850.2. Calibrate! Despite the note in the box that says  it\'s been calibrated, it has not. I found some calibration settings for this monitor on reddit and I will post them below.-(If you have changed anything, first go to General->Reset to get back to defaults)-Picture Adjust->Brightness: 26-Picture Adjust->R/G/B-Red 47-Green 49-Blue 45-General->SMART ENERGY SAVING->OffI couldn\'t be happier with this purchase and I\'d highly recommend it to anyone who games or just wants great picture quality.\n\nRead more\n331 people found this helpful\n\n          Helpful\n\n\nReport abuse\nChristopher J. Gilmore4.0 out of 5 stars\nThis one is going to be hard to beat\nReviewed in the United States on October 31, 2019Style: 27"" QHD IPS 1ms with 144HzPattern Name: MonitorVerified Purchase\n\n  For under $380 I think it\'s going to be hard to beat this monitor. Especially since the 27GL850 is consistently out of stock. For the price you are getting:- Essentially the same panel as the 27GL850- Excellent response time + motion handling- Officially certified by Nvidia G-Sync support- FreeSync- sRGB color space- More money in your pocket- You can actually find this monitor in stockWhat\'s missing from it\'s bigger brother:- No USB ports- No wide gamut color support- No HDR (there isn\'t really any true HDR on the 850 either so you\'re not technically missing out)I didn\'t notice any back light bleed, stuck pixels, or excessive IPS glow on my unit. I almost hesitate to include pictures of the monitor when it\'s on because the pictures do not accurately show what I\'m seeing in person. In the pictures it looks as if there may be some excessive glow in the top right and bottom left of the screen but I assure you that I absolutely do not see that in person and only via my camera.The contrast is ok.

Up until now, I\'ve only ever had descriptions and seen photos (on less than ideal monitors) of what to expect. So my review here may almost certainly be biased in terms of extremes for both pros and cons.With that out of the way, let me just say.. wow, being my first experience with an IPS, I was absolutely blown away with just how much the colors explode off the screen compared to a TN panel. You get used to it very quickly but you definitely have those moments where you\'re just like ""Damn, that looks really good.""The exact same can be said about the refresh rate. If you\'re coming from 60hz, the difference is absolutely staggering. It\'s noticeable the moment you slide the cursor across the screen. It\'ll give you goosebumps at first. And again, it\'s something you\'ll get used to very quickly but will repeatedly be reminded of how smooth any and all motion appears at the most seemingly benign places. Especially with Windows 10 and it\'s very quick but subtle flow to almost any menu and interaction. Simply opening up the start menu or action center will just appear to glide in as though it was never on the screen but just floating above it.And finally the jump from 1080p to 1440p was much nicer than I had anticipated. My mind knew it was a half way mark between 1080 and 4K but my expectations were more inline with something more subtle. Nope. You\'re getting a massive upgrade in pixels here. The best thing about 1440p is that it truly is a half way sweet spot between 1080p performance and 4K sharpness when talking about gaming. The amount of extra power needed isn\'t insignificant, you will notice a loss in performance, however if you\'re rocking an RTX 2070 or equivalent GPU, it\'s safe to say that while you might not always get the best out of its 144hz refresh rate, you\'ll almost certainly exceed the 60hz you\'re probably accustomed to and it really does make a huge difference. 60fps just doesn\'t feel like a good performance anymore. It feels like what 30fps felt like on a 60hz monitor.Of course it\'s also worth mentioning a few ""buts"" now.The G-Sync on this thing is incredible. I can finally turn off vsync and not get those incredibly distracting screen tears which I\'m unlucky enough to be very sensitive to. However it\'s worth noting that this is NOT a G-Sync monitor. It does not have the proper hardware to support G-Sync at its best. It\'s G-Sync compatible. Which is to say, it was built for FreeSync but after Nvidias driver update opened G-Sync to FreeSync monitors, this monitor was able to pass the certification process and be sold as being compatible with G-Sync with no real issues. The problem with this might seem nuance but it\'s worth mentioning. G-Sync will NOT work at framerates lower than 40fps. Once you drop below that, you\'ll start noticing screen tearing as the monitor doesn\'t have the hardware to stay in sync with the GPU at lower refresh rates. Not a deal breaker but just something to keep in mind. If you\'re still rocking older hardware, you might be lowering settings to accommodate the higher resolution at G-Sync speeds or resorting to turning vsync back on.Finally there\'s the IPS glow. It\'s there. It\'s absolutely there. It\'s both not as bad and worse than I expected but it\'s well within tolerance as I quickly get sucked into what I\'m doing and stop noticing it. Unlike backlight bleed, IPS glow shifts around the screen based on your relative position and angle. It\'s easy to adjust the monitor in such a way that it\'s a minimal issue but due to the size of the display, it\'s impossible to sit at any position or angle and not see some IPS glow somewhere. Usually in the top corners as tilting the monitor up seems to offer the least about of glow.How much this bothers you it\'s going to heavily depend on what kind of content you\'ll be playing. Darker colors show IPS glow much more than brighter scenes. So brighter games like Spyro will hide it almost entirely, but darker games like Control can be real hit or miss and if you\'re not used to it yet, probably annoying. But it\'s a small price to pay for the kind of color you get over TN monitors.\n\nRead more\n103 people found this helpful\n\n          Helpful\n\n\nReport abuse\nSee all reviews', 'Top reviews\n      \n\n        Most recent\n      \nTop reviews', 'Top reviews\n      \n\n        Most recent\n      \nTop reviews', 'Top reviews', 'Top reviews', 'Top reviews', 'Top reviews', '', '', 'Customer', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '', 'Great gaming monitor!', 'Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2020', 'Style: 27"" QHD IPS 1ms with 144HzPattern Name: Monitor', 'Verified Purchase', ""Don't cheap out and buy the $250 Viotek IPS like I did.

But it\'s a small price to pay for the kind of color you get over TN monitors.', 'Read more', '103 people found this helpful\n\n          Helpful', '103 people found this helpful', 'Helpful', 'Helpful', 'Report abuse', 'Report abuse', 'Report abuse', 'Top reviews from other countries\n        \n        \n      \n    \n\n\nTranslate all reviews to English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeo4.0 out of 5 stars\nBuen monitor para uso mixto\nReviewed in Mexico on January 8, 2020Style: 27"" QHD IPS 1ms with 144HzPattern Name: MonitorVerified Purchase\n\n  LO BUENO- Tiene resolución 1440p (también conocido como 2K) lo cual da una imagen con mayor nitidez, es mas notorio al momento de hacer tareas que impliquen leer mucho texto- La tasa de refresco es de 144 hz lo cual hace que la imagen se vea con mucha más fluidez, es bastante útil al jugar juegos, realmente se nota el cambio respecto a un monitor de 60 hz- Tiene Freesync y además la certificación de “G-sync compatible” por lo que podrá usarse tanto con tarjetas de AMD como de Nvidea sin problema, esta tecnología lo que hace es sincronizar la tasa de refresco del monitor con la tarjeta de video para eliminar el tearing- El panel es de tipo IPS, los ángulos de visión son muy amplios pero los colores no son tan buenos como uno podría esperar de un panel IPS (más adelante explicó porque)- El soporte o base del monitor es bastante ergonomico, te permite regular la altura e inclinación además de ponerlo en vertical- Es compatible con montura VESA, así que se puede montar en cualquier soporte en caso de que el que viene de fabrica no sea suficienteLO MALO- Mala uniformidad de color, el color no es el mismo en toda la pantalla, es algo que se ve a simple vista, por ejemplo, al poner un fondo blanco, el lado izquierdo de la pantalla se ve ligeramente mas rojizo que el lado derecho, pero quizá a otras personas no les moleste en lo absoluto- No cuenta con bocinas integradas, se tiene que usar un sistema de sonido aparte- El cable de alimentación es muy corto (1 metro aproximadamente)\n\nRead more\n16 people found this helpful\nReport abuse\nTranslate review to EnglishLuke P.5.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat Monitor\nReviewed in Canada on March 1, 2021Style: 27"" QHD IPS 1ms with 144HzPattern Name: MonitorVerified Purchase\n\n  Pros:-Well-built, good quality materials-Freesync/G-sync compatible works well-Easy to use -Navigation with the single analog button is great-Excellent picture quality-Thin bezels-144hz as advertised and it\'s a smooth experience-Comes with an HDMI and DisplayPort cable.-Better price than other monitors with the same specificationsCons:-V-shaped base, I prefer square-shaped ones for desk space and the visual aesthetic-Red accents, would have preferred it all black or with blue accents.-Out-of-box settings were not well calibrated and I had to spend quite some time changing them to get the right tones and contrast.-Screen is a bit wobbly on its stand, but not really noticeable as you\'re not constantly touching the monitor.-Quite expensive - though all monitors that have specifications comparable to this are around the same price point and usually more expensive - so in that regard, it\'s a good deal.\n\nRead more\nOne person found this helpful\nReport abuse\nDan1.0 out of 5 stars\nDon\'t buy these, no usb = no way to update firmware\nReviewed in Canada on January 23, 2020Style: 27"" QHD IPS 1ms with 144HzPattern Name: MonitorVerified Purchase\n\n  I ordered 2 of these and immediately had issues.

Fair warning though on some things I didn’t realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you’re exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to “work properly” I don’t like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven’t had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way.

I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.\n\nRead more\n1,167 people found this helpful\n\n          Helpful\n\n\nReport abuse\nErin4.0 out of 5 stars\nGPS is good, special edition band is not...\nReviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase\n\n  Fitbit's App:Let me start by saying, the Fitbit app is unparalleled for sleep, diet and water tracking. I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.\n\nRead more\n648 people found this helpful\n\n          Helpful\n\n\nReport abuse\nJonathan Arrazola1.0 out of 5 stars\nWont turn on during set up.\nReviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase\n\n  I finally received my Fitbit and unfortunately it just has a black screen.

Growing ever frustrated, I switched to the Charge 4 on hearing Fitbit had introduced an in-built GPS, in the hope of having relatively accurate data.On these grounds, I am not disappointed. The GPS is really very good, particularly for what you pay. Having tested in on a number of different runs and cycles, predominately in woodland, I've found that it's very accurate (particularly in comparison to the Charge 3).I'm not so bothered about the Spotify or pay features (if you're UK-based), which I know others are grumbling about. In my opinion, if you want these sorts of features, you should look for a smartwatch. I find these sorts pretty gimmicky / useless if you're looking for a fitness tracker which isn't designed to be a smartwatch. I've also not had the technical issues which some seem to have.The battery is definitely nowhere near as good as the Charge 3. I suspect this is because of the GPS - which they DO advertise. I've noticed I'm having to plug in my Charge 4 twice at least twice as frequently as the Charge 3 (going for at least 3 runs and 2 cycles with GPS per week). This can be a little jarring if you're used to the battery of a Charge 3, but considering the size of the device with GPS running, I think people are being too harsh on the battery life.All-in-all, I'm pleased with the device. Fundamentally, it's not going to let you run or cycle for 4+ hours using GPS (particularly in GPS challenging scenarios). If this is a problem for you, look elsewhere, but be aware you're not going to find a device which is as slim and powerful. I'd recommend this device if you're looking for a slimline activity tracker which is GPS enabled, it reads your heart-rate, has a sleep-tracker and connects to a clever app. The price and quality seem to be near-unrivalled in the field, so I really do think there have been some overly strong criticisms of this device.\n\nRead more\n223 people found this helpful\nReport abuse\nAmazon Customer2.0 out of 5 stars\nMASSIVELY dissappointed by the battery life.\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2020Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase\n\n  A single 10k run (c. 1 hour 20 minutes, incl. warm up and cool down) took the battery from 60% to 9%Absolutely no chance of using this to track a half marathon, then...Update:.
